# CS307: Operating Systems – The  Chronicles

Welcome, noble traveler, to the grand chronicle of CS307: Operating Systems. Within these digital tomes, you will find the relics of our academic battles—programming assignments and detailed reports—each forged in the venerable language of C. Much like the ancient heroes of the Warhammer Fantasy world, we embark on quests to tame the chaotic realms of processes, memory, and more.

## The Quest for Knowledge

In a world where the forces of chaos threaten the order of the digital empire, our mission is to master the arcane arts of operating systems. Each assignment is a trial by fire—a skirmish against the unruly legions of bugs and inefficiencies. With courage and discipline, we document every conquest and setback, ensuring that our wisdom may guide future generations of code warriors.

## The Scrolls of Code (Programming Assignments)

- **Language of the Ancients:**  
  All programming assignments are written in C—a language as enduring and powerful as Sigmar’s mighty hammer.  
- **Trials of the Code:**  
  Each PA is a strategic battle: implementing system calls, managing memory like a siege, and orchestrating processes with the precision of an elven archer.  
- **For the Glory of the Empire:**  
  Let every pointer, every function, be a tribute to our quest for order in the midst of chaos.

## The Tomes of Wisdom (Reports)

- **Chronicles of the Battlefield:**  
  Detailed reports accompany every assignment, chronicling our victories and the lessons learned from our defeats.  
- **Analyses and Aftermaths:**  
  These documents serve as both reflections on past encounters and guides for future conquests, much like the scrolls of ancient heroes.  
- **A Legacy of Learning:**  
  The insights within these tomes are intended to endure, inspiring all who follow the path of the code warrior.


## How to Forge Your Own Path

- **Compiling Your Armory:**  
  Each C assignment is to be compiled with your trusted compiler—a forge where raw code becomes battle-ready weaponry.
- **Deploying on the Battlefield:**  
  Execute your programs as you would deploy your finest regiments. Beware of ambushes in the form of bugs, and adapt with the agility of a seasoned warrior.
- **Test Cases & Skirmishes:**  
  Detailed test cases are provided to simulate real-world challenges. Use them to prepare your defenses and sharpen your skills.

## The Oath of the Code Warrior

As you delve into this repository, remember these sacred tenets:

- **Discipline and Honor:**  
  Just as a warrior abides by his code, so must you craft your programs with precision and clarity. Comment your code and structure it with care.
- **Relentless Improvement:**  
  Learn from every battle. Analyze each failure and triumph as a stepping stone toward mastery.
- **Unity in Purpose:**  
  Collaborate with fellow warriors. Share your insights, debate strategies, and build a community that stands as strong as the walls of Altdorf.
